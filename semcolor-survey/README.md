# Introduction
This is a simple survey website we wrote using php and js. We used php to randomly select 16 images from the dataset and 16 images from our model's prediction (NST or End2End model which you can specify it by 'type' parameter in "http://x.x.x.x/index.php?type=nst" type can be 'nst' or 'end2end'). 32 images are randomly placed on the website. The participant should select 16 images which they think are colourized by our model. After the submission, they will get a score which is the ratio of the number of images are prediction by our model and from user's selection and the number of images from dataset indicates user's accuracy. In the paper we use 1 minus this score to represent our model's accuracy.
